# Overview
This was a project for my Uni's Unity Capstone Design class.
Though, at this point i was already experienced with Unity and decided to build a survival zombie FPS. The game is heavily inspired from Killing Floor series.
<br>
<br>
**Platform** : PC (Windows x64)<br>
**Development Period** : 1 Month (Nov 2019 ~ Dec 2019)<br>
**Lead Developer** : Yonghyun Kim<br>
**Other Teammates** : Seunghee Yoon, Yoonjae Kim<br>
- GUI was done with NGUI.
- Developed and built with Unity 2019.1.14

# How to Play
In this demo you will face with 1 regular wave, and 1 boss wave.
Key bindings can be seen when you start the game. They're standard WSAD+Mouse bindings with few extra keys.

Defeating the boss results in victory. Else, dying results in game over. Simple.

## Disclaimer About Some Assets
There is heavy use of audio assets from other commercial games and you might recognize them.
I am aware this might raise questions, But this game was for class, and never was intended to be sold commercially.
( Or, at least - replace all of them with assets we can hold rights to. )

Other assets - such as 3D Models were bought from Unity Asset store.
